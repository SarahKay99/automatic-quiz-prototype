---EYE ANATOMY---
---BMS1052 NOTES---
---By Sarah Kay---

Light rays from distant objects are parallel.
When light rays are refracted at the cornea, they converge to a point in the retina where they're picked up as an image.

Near sight requires stronger lens of the cornea and weaker ciliary muscles -> Ciliary muscles relax.
Far sight requires weaker lens of the cornea and stronger ciliary muscles -> Ciliary muscles tense.

An image is created where light rays converge after refraction.

---ANATOMY OF THE EYE---

%Lens: Transparent, flexible tissue responsible for focusing light images onto the retina.%
	Located directly behind the iris and the pupil.

%Iris: A thin circular structure in the eye, responsible for dilating and contracting the pupil.%
	Located directly in front of the lens.
	Colored based on genetics.
	Contains the:
		Dilator pupillae
		Sphincter pupillae

%Ciliary body: A group of tiny muscles which control the shape of the lens.%
	Supplied by long posterior ciliary arteries.

%Pupil: Part of the eye where light enters through.%
	Dilates and contracts based on how much light is in the outside world.
	Directs light to the retina.
	Its diameter is controlled by the iris.

%Choroid: The vascular layer of the eye which contains connective tissues.%
	Located between the retina and the sclera.

%Conjunctiva: A thin transparent layer of tissue that lines the inner surface of the eyelid. Covers the white part of the eye too.%
	Can become inflamed to cause "conjunctivitis", or "pink eye".

%Fovea: A small pit located in the macula of the retina. Layers of the retina are spread aside in this area, to allow light to come into direct contact with cones.%
	Contains the most visual receptors.
	Highest accuity.
	Highest spatial sensitivity.

%Macula: Located near the centre of the retina of the human eye. Contains the fovea.%

%Cornea: The clear, protective outer layer of the eye, responsible for focusing images onto the retina. In front of the eye only.%
	An extension of the sclera layer, with some extra protections.

%Sclera: The white of your eye.%

%Refraction: A change in direction of light waves.%

%Diopter: A unit of measurement. The higher its value is, the closer the lens it focuses are.%

%Myopia: The medical name for short-sightedness.%
	The eyeball is too long.
	The lens is too strong.
	Corrected with a concave lens. 	
	When one suffers from this disorder for too long, the eyeball adapts by getting longer, exacerbating the problem.

%Hyperopia: The medical name for far-sightedness.%
	Accommodation of the lens can still occur (the lens can still adjust).
	The eyeball is too short.
	The lens is too weak. 
	Corrected with a convex lens. 

%Presbyopia: Far-sightedness caused by loss of elasticity in the lens. Common with aging.%
	Accomodation of the lens cannot occur.

---DIOPTRES---

Since the cornea and the lens work together to focus images onto the retina, their refraction power in dioptres matters.

Ideally, the cornea is ~42 dioptres.
The lens is ~20 dioptres.

The lens flattens to process distant light. The ciliary muscles tense to tighten zonule fibres and flatten the lens.
The lens becomes round to focus near-light. The ciliary muscles relax to loosen zonule fibres and round the lens.

Rounder lens have HIGHER refractive power. 
Longer, flatter lens have LOWER refractive power.

Steps of vision:

Light entering the eye is refracted to form a focused image at the retina.
The light touches the fovea, where it comes into contact with rods and cones.

---CELLS OF THE EYE, RODS, CONES---

Layers of the retina: 

%Pigment epithelium: A single layer of highly pigmented cells that support photoreceptor health.%
%Rods: Receptor cells with high light sensitivity. Active in low light levels.%
	There is only one type of rod. There is a single range of wavelength sensitivity for rods.	
	Made of light-absorbing proteins.
	Contain photoreceptors.

%Cones: Receptor cells with low light sensitivity. Active in high light levels.%
	There are three different types of cones, with a different range of wavelength sensitivities.
	Can perceive different colors as a result of perceiving different wavelengths.
	Made of light-absorbing proteins.
	Contain photoreceptors.

Conjunctiva 
%Muller cells: Glial cells in the retina, which are responsible for homeostatic and metabolic support of retinal neurons.%
%Horizontal cells: Cells that receive input from multiple photoreceptor cells.%
%Bipolar cells: Central neurons of the retina, which carry light-elicted signals from photoreceptors and horizontal cells.%
%Amacrine cells: Inhibitory neurons that project their dendritic arbors onto the inner plexiform layer.%
%Ganglion cells: Cells that create action potentials with light signals.%
%Nerve fiber layer: A layer consisting of ganglion cell axons, which proeed towards the optic nerve.%
%Inner limiting membrane: The basal lamina of the inner retina. Formed by the footplates of Muller cells. The border between the retina and the vitreous humor.%

----- 

%Opsin photopigments: Substances found on rods and cones which absorb light and produce a conformational change.%

Rods: High light sensitivity. Active in low light times, such as at night-time.
Cones: Less sensitivity to light than rods. Active in well-lit times, such as the day time

Rods are active at night-time when you need to perceive as much light as possible.
Cones are active in the daytime when there's a lot of light and you don't need to perceive much. 

-----

%Blue cones: Cones that can perceive short (high-frequency) wavelengths.%
%Green cones: Cones that can perceive medium wavelengths.%
%Red cones: Cones that can perceive long (low-frequency) wavelengths.%

%Photoreceptors: Neurons that exist on rods and cones, which are made of light-absorbing proteins.%

%Color-blindness: Occurs when a type of cone is missing or malfunctioning.%

%Pupilary light reflex: A clinically significant reflex used to assess cranial nerve and brainstem function. Involves only 4 synapses.%

Photoreceptors --> Bipolar cells --> Ganglion cells

-----

%Phototransduction: The conversion of light into electrical signals.%
	Occurs when the photoreceptor's membrane potential changes.

%Photoreceptors: Non-spiking neurons responsible for receiving light.% 

In darkness, the membrane potential of a rod is around -30mV.

Relative cone activation accounts for color perception.
