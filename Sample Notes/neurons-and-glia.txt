CNS stands for Central Nervous System.
PNS stands for Peripheral Nervous System. 

Main cell classes in the nervous system:

	Neurons
	Glia

-----

Neurons:

~86 billion cells.
Contain axons.
Contain dendrites.
Responsible for information processing in the NS.

-----

Glia:

~100 billion cells
Supporting cells in the NS.
4 main types

-----

There are a lot of ribosomes in neurons.

-----

Important components of neurons:

%Neuronal membrane: Seperates the intra and extracellular spaces of the neuron.%
%Ribosome: Synthesizes the specialized, membrane-bound proteins of neurons.%
%Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum: Site of protein synthesis. Attaches ribosomes. Also called Nissl bodies.%
	%SS Rough Endoplastic Reticulum: Nissl bodies%
%Mitochondria: Converts ADP to ATP, providing energy for the membrane-bound ion pumps.%

-----

Neurons need a lot of mitochondria because they consume lots of energy in proportion to their size. 

---What makes a neuron special?---

Neural structures:

	%Neural processes: Parts of the neuron which protrude.%
		The function of these is to receive and transmit information.

	%Dendritic arbor: A tree of the dendritic connections between neurons.%
		The dendritic arbor of a region corresponds to its function.
		You can study the dendritic arbor of a region, to explain its function.

-----

Neural processes: 

	%Axons: Protruding neural structures which transmit energy away from the cell.%
	%Dendrites: Protruding neural structures which transmit energy towards the cell.%
		Receive input from the axons on other neurons. 
		Receive input on specialized structures called dendritic spines.
		Contain MAP2.
	%Dendritic spines: Small extensions of the neural cell membrane, where the neuron receives input from other neurons.%
		Sized on the micrometre scale. 
		Come in various shapes. 
		Contain actin.
		Connected to the dendrite.

-----

Neurons can send and receive input from thousands of neurons at a time.
The density and length of dendritic spines affects one's development.
Mentally retarded infants have longer dendritic spines, and their dendrites are thinner. 
Often, mentally disabled people are suffering from their brain's inability to prune unhelpful neural connections. This makes their brains less efficient. 

---WHY DO NEURONS VARY IN STRUCTURE?---

%Neurite: An axon, dendrite or dendritic spine.%
	Synonyms: Neural processes, Neuronal processes. 

%Soma: The "body" of the neuron; the neuron minus the processes.% 

-----

Neurons vary in:

	Number of neurites
	Shape
	Dendrites 
	Connections
	Axon length
	%Neurotransmitters: Specialized chemicals which communicate information to other neurons.%

-----

%Stellate cells: Neurons which collate information locally within a brain region.%
	Part of a shorter dendritic arbor.
	Are often, but not always, short cells.

%Pyramidal cells: Neurons which send information to other brain regions.%
	Part of a longer dendritic arbor.
	Are often, but not always, long cells.

%Sensory neuron: Receive information from the outside world.%
	Synonyms: afferent neuron.
	Found commonly in the peripheral nervous system.

%Interneuron: Transmit information between neurons.%
	Receive input from some neurons.
	Distribute output to other neurons.
	Found commonly in the central nervous system.

%Motor neurons: Transmit information to bodily structures such as glands, muscles, etc.%
	%S: efferent neuron%
	Found commonly in the peripheral nervous system.

Neurons vary in structure because different neurons have different functions. 
Dendritic arbors vary in structure because different regions have different functions.

---NEURONAL SKELETON---

%Cytoskeleton: Forms the shape of the neuron and controls its movement.%

Neuron shape is dynamic. 
MAPs stands for Microtubule-associated proteins.

%MAPs: Intracellular proteins which regulate the assembly of microfilaments.%

-----

Cytoskeleton elements:

%Microtubles: The widest tubule type of the cytoskeleton, ~20nm wide.%
	Run longitudinally down neurites.
	Form "roads" for intracellular transport.
	MAPs regulate their assembly and function.
	
%Neurofilaments: The second-widest tubule type of the cytoskeleton, ~10nm wide.%
	Provide structural support to the neuron.
	Regulate the diameter of axons.
	Regulate the speed of information transmission.

%Microfilaments: The thinnest tubule type of the cytoskeleton, ~5nm wide.%
	Linked to microtubules and cell membrane.
	Comprised of actin molecules.
	Responsible for the movement of axons and dendrites.
	The movement they provide allows neurons to form connections.
